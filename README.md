## Resume

The purpose of this REPO is to present my resume in more depth and to display my current skills in Web development!
Initial commits complated in July for my code Louisville Project. All commits completed after July 26 are personal updates as my resume changes and as I run across new skills in CSS, HTML and JS.

On this page I used bootstrap, css, html, jquery, and javascript.

The JS/JQuery was used to make the accordian collapse main content section, the contact modal button, and my links and PDF's to open in a seperate tab. The accordian feature is managed by bootstrap and the others are written by myself.
